        Are You Aware of the Harmful Ingredients in Your Shampoo That Could Be Affecting Your Health and the Environment?
      </h1>
      <h2 id = header1>
        Many popular shampoos contain chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances that can cause skin irritation, hormonal disruptions, and even contribute to long-term health issues. Additionally, ingredients like microplastics and certain preservatives can persist in the environment, polluting our water systems and harming aquatic life. Staying informed of the dangerous ingredients in YOUR shampoo and choose shampoos with natural, biodegradable ingredients can protect both your well-being and the planet. Make an informed choice for a healthier you and a cleaner world.

        Common, yet Harmful Ingredients in Shampoo
      </h1>

      <h1 id = title> Sulfates (e.g., Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate):<br></h1>
      <h2 id = info>
        <b>Why they're used:</b> Sulfates are surfactants that help create a lather, which can make shampooing feel more effective.<br>
        <b>Potential harm:</b> Sulfates can be toxic to aquatic organisms. They can also contribute to water pollution by creating excess foam in rivers and lakes, which can harm aquatic life. They can also strip the scalp of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. They may also cause allergic reactions and eye irritation.

      <h1 id = title> Parabens (e.g., Methylparaben, Propylparaben):<br></h1>
      <h2 id = info>Why they're used: Parabens are preservatives used to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold.
        <br>Potential harm: Parabens can persist in the environment and have been detected in marine organisms. They can disrupt the endocrine systems of aquatic life. They have been linked to hormonal disruptions because they can mimic estrogen in the body. There is some concern they may be linked to breast cancer, although research is ongoing.
